The answer to this question will be different depending on which applies to you; I have been given a deadline prior to, or during the June exam period As long as you submit your final coursework by this deadline (and are carrying no other reassessments), it is expected that your work will be marked and will not prevent you from graduating. I have been given an indication that I will be submitting this work prior to, or during the August reassessment period At the point schools come together to confirm finalist awards in June/July you will not have completed all of your assessments, therefore you will not be eligible to graduate in the summer. Can I ask for an earlier deadline to enable me to graduate? Where you have been awarded a long extension into the August reassessment period it is often because you will be given a different assignment to work on. Where this is the case, you will not be given the new assignment/means to submit sufficiently early to graduate in July. Where you know your assignment topic will not change, you may submit earlier than your deadline, however we expect it will be marked with other reassessment work in<span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW53363852 B",

The ECregulation is clear that if your extenuating circumstance claim is upheld, the outcome awarded is not optional.This is because in submitting the claim you have stated that you believe the circumstance affecting you will have a demonstrably significant, negative impact on your ability to study or to undertake an assessment. When the outcome of the claim is to grant another attempt at that assessment, we will try to ensure that the original (affected) assessment is not marked, or if it is that the mark is not released to you. However, due to short timescales associated with marking, particularly around the time of examination boards, this is not always possible. In these situations the mark will be voided and you will still be expected to complete the reassessment.However, we recognise that circumstances change and you have an opportunity to request that your claim is withdrawn. The request for withdrawal should be made at the earliest opportunity via the student enquiry centre(select 01. Assessment, coursework, and exams from the 'I want to ask about dropdown option). This will be directed to your local assessments team for review. Unless the mark has already been shared, withdrawal requests made within five working days of an exam will be accepted.For coursework claims, cancellations can only be made up to the original deadline. In the small number of cases where the work has been marked and that mark (confirmed or provisional) has been shared with you already, theclaim cannot be withdrawn.The mark will be voided and you will still be expected to complete the reassessment.

Extenuating circumstances (ECs) are events that affect your performance in assessments which are unforeseen and out of your control. Our EC procedure is intended to support students with these exceptional, short-term circumstances. In the first instance we recommend that you notify, for example, your Personal Tutor (or Here for You Guide), PhD supervisor or theSupport and Wellbeing team, as soon as possible. These people will be able to provide advice and direct you to appropriate procedures or support services, if applicable. If you’ve discussed your circumstances and you identify you need to make a claim under theExtenuating Circumstances procedure, you will need to let us know byraising anextenuating circumstances claimvia the student enquiry centre.Your claim will be reviewed and you’ll be informed of the outcome of your claim via email. If you have a Support Plan that states on it that extensions to deadlines in relation to your disability should be allowed on request, you do not necessarily need to complete an extenuating circumstances form. Refer to theprocedure for Students with Support Plansthat makes reference to extension.There is a helpful flowchart on this page that might help to work out which process is the right one for you. If the issue affecting you is a long-term one, then an EC is not the appropriate route to go down. In these circumstances, you should seekadviceon getting a Support Plan in place.

    "Title": "What are acceptable circumstances for an EC claim?",
    "Content": "There are many circumstances that can impact your performance in an exam or assessment, there are full details on what's acceptable in theEC Procedure,and a summary of those reasons is shown below. The University EC Regulations are outlined hereand the UniversityPolicy on Circumstances Affecting Students’ Ability to Study and Complete Assessmentsis outlined here. Illness Acceptable circumstances:This is usually illness that spans more than 7 days for coursework, but can include acute cases for exams. This includes students who have had a late diagnosis of a disabilityor long-term medical condition. Unacceptable circumstances:Short-term illness (less than 7 days) are not normally acceptable circumstances with regards coursework, where the student is given a number of weeks/months to complete and submit such work.As general guidance an illness/ailment that does not require medical treatment or does not lead to a student being bedridden or will not cause a significant risk to others will not normally be acceptable circumstances. Minor illnesses (e.g. colds) are not acceptable circumstances. Hospitalisation Acceptable circumstances:This circumstance is generally limited to extended or particularly seriously acute stays in hospital. Unacceptable circumstances:A short visit to minor injuries unit or A&amp;E would not normally be considered acceptable circumstances. Acute injury Acceptable circumstances:If you have recently had an accident, injury or are experiencing a short-term health condition (for the first time), you may be in a position to request a short-term adjustment for your upcoming in-person exams (e.g. a scribe if you have broken your hand, or more time/rest breaks). Family illness Acceptable circumstances:The claim should make clear the nature of the relationship between the student and the affected relative and how the student’s ability to study has been impacted. This would normally only include close relatives (i.e. parents, siblings) but, with that concept in mind, it should be recognised that family structures vary. These would usually be a short-term condition. However, where the circumstances are external to the student and extend over more than one semester, such as chronic illness of a relative, it may be appropriate to accept the same circumstances for a longer period than one semester if it is not appropriate for the student to voluntarily interrupt their studies. In such circumstances the student must discuss the situation with their School/Department and submit an extenuating circumstances form each semester to ensure that appropriate account is taken of the circumstances and appropriate support can be offered to the student. Unacceptable circumstances:This would not normally be extended to family pets. Bereavement Acceptable circumstances:The claim should make clear the nature of the relationship between the student and the deceased and how the student’s ability to study has been impacted. The circumstances of the bereavement may also be relevant. Unacceptable circumstances:This would not normally be extended to family pets. IT and/or computer failure during e-examinations Acceptable circumstances:This relates to the period of an e-exam only (not for coursework or exam revision). This applies whether the exam is undertaken online remotely or on UoN facilities. Evidence will always be required. Unacceptable circumstances:For e-exams, loss or corruption of files is not an acceptable extenuating circumstance. It is the student's responsibility to ensure that all work which is electronically stored, generated and/or submitted is sufficiently backed up, including backing up drafts of the work to the cloud or external sources. IT and/or computer failure more broadly Unacceptable circumstances:For assessed coursework (or exam revision), loss or corruption of files is not an acceptable extenuating circumstance. It is the student's responsibility to ensure that all work which is electronically stored, generated and/or submitted is sufficiently backed up, including backing up drafts of the work to the cloud or external sources.Withdrawal of IT facilities or suspension for reason of debt are not acceptable circumstances. Acute personal / emotional circumstances Acceptable circumstances:These may be considered acceptable circumstances, but students will need to demonstrate that they are seeking appropriate support including liaison with their personal tutor (or Here for You Guide). Unacceptable circumstances:As with all extenuating circumstances, the University must be told about these circumstances in a timely manner (prior to the cut offs given in the extenuating circumstances procedure). Pregnancy Acceptable circumstances:The University has apolicy on pregnancy related issues. Students who are pregnant should follow the guidance in this document. In some cases it may be appropriate to use the extenuating circumstances procedure (for instance when a student suffers from a specific illness caused by the pregnancy), in which case the requirements for illness orhospitalisation above should be followed. <div class=\"collapsible_panel_head\" tabindex=\"0\" onclick=\"var head = this;var icon = this.firstElementChild;var body = this.nextElementSibling;if (body && body.classList.contains('collapsible_panel_body')) {if (body.style.display === 'block') {icon.style.content = 'url(data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyMDQ4IDIwNDgiIHdpZHRoPSIzMiIgaGVpZ2h0PSIzMiI+DQogIDxwYXRoIGQ9Ik02NTggMjAyM2wtMTIxLTEyMSA4NzgtODc4LTg3OC04NzhMNjU4IDI1bDk5OSA5OTktOTk5IDk5OXoiIC8+DQo8L3N2Zz4=)';body.style.display = 'none';}else { icon.style.content = 'url(data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyMDQ4IDIwNDgiIHdpZHRoPSIzMiIgaGVpZ2h0PSIzMiI+DQogIDxwYXRoIGQ9Ik0xMDI0IDE2NTdMMjUgNjU4bDEyMS0xMjEgODc4IDg3OCA4NzgtODc4IDEyMSAxMjEtOTk5IDk5OXoiIC8+DQo8L3N2Zz4=)';body.style.display = 'block';}}\" onkeypress=\"if (event.keyCod",

    "Content": "Other terms used to describe this status might be ‘resit/first sit in attendance’, ‘reassessment with teaching’, ‘repeat stage/semester’ What does it mean to me? During this period you will be doing resits/first sits, you will also be fully registered and attending the university. Your modules are usually the same as the first time but your assessments may differ from those originally taken. You will also be liable for fees as you will be attending all teaching related to the modules you are repeating. Although the term states ‘resit’, this description is also accurate if you are doing ‘first sits’. This is also known as ‘repeat the stage/semester’.See our FAQs to read about the difference between resits and first sits if you aren’t sure. The list of modules you are required to complete across the semester/year will be on Blue Castle and in your NottinghamHub account. Do I need to register? Yes. You will need to complete online registration for the relevant academic session with the university as you are effectively ‘repeating’ all or part of the previous year's teaching and assessment. You will be sent an email from the university when it is time to do this. What does it mean financially? You will be charged a tuition fee by the university which may be pro-rata depending on how many credits you are taking. For example, if you are taking 60 credits you will generally pay half of the standard full year fee. Student Finance will award you funding for the length of your course plus one year. As long as you haven’t already used your plus one, or ‘gift’ year you will be able to apply as usual for your tuition fee loan and loan for living costs.(NB - If you have already used your gift year, depending on the reason for this you may be able to apply for additional years’ funding from Student Finance due to ‘Compelling Personal Reasons’.)If you are in attendance for a semester or term, rather than a full academic year, then Student Finance will pro-rata your funding for living costs. During the period you are registered you will also be eligible to apply for university Bursaries/Scholarships and Hardship Funds. <span style=\"font-size: 16p",

The phrase ‘resit not in attendance’ means that although you will be required to do one or more reassessments (these could be first sits or resits) during this/the next academic year, you are not required to attend any teaching in relation to those assessments - therefore your teaching timetable is expected to be blank. What will happen to my IT and facilities access? You should retain access to your email and all learning materials on Moodle related to these assessments. Please contact your module convenor if you need support with this. You will not get access to the current year's Moodle pages as there may have been curriculum changes affecting the assessment. You will maintain access to the library and all facilities. Exams will show on your individual exam timetable, if you are resitting any coursework elements, please contact the module convenor directly for information on content and deadlines.
