Core considerations\nThis guidance supports the University’s Extenuating Circumstances Procedure and should be read\nin conjunction with the procedure.\nIn order to be considered under this procedure, circumstances must meet all of the following criteria:\n• They must be out of the student’s control – the student could not have prevented them.\n• They must have had an impact – they must have had a demonstrably negative impact on the\nstudent’s ability to study or to undertake an assessment.\n• The timing of the circumstances must be relevant to the claimed impact.\n2. Standard of evidence\n• With the limited exception of the circumstances provided for in the Examination Self-Certification\nPolicy, all claims made under the Extenuating Circumstances Procedure must be supported by\nindependent, reliable documentary evidence of inability to comply with the assessment\nrequirements or to attend teaching or undertake required study.\n• The burden of proof to support a claim lies with the student at all times.\n• Evidence presented by students must meet the following standards and should:\na. Where written by appropriately qualified professionals who are independent of the\nstudent, be on headed paper and signed and dated by the author. Evidence presented\nby email may be acceptable if the email has been sent by the author from the official\ndomain name of the author's organisation. Students should note that the Cripps Health\nCentre and the University Counselling Service in the UK or equivalent services on other\ncampuses will be unlikely to provide such confirmation if the student has had no\nengagement with the service(s) prior to the affected assessment(s).\nb. Confirm specifically that the circumstances were witnessed on the relevant date as\nopposed to being reported retrospectively."

For information\nabout the policy from 25 September 2023 onwards, please visit our extenuating\ncircumstances webpages.\nGuidance on Recommendations for EC Panels\n1. Core considerations\nThis guidance supports the University’s Extenuating Circumstances Procedure and should be read\nwith the procedure.\nAn Extenuating Circumstances Panel cannot change marks; marks or classifications can only be\naltered by reassessment or the setting aside of a module or element of a module when computing a\nmark or classification. The full range of recommendations open to a Panel are detailed below.\nPanels should always consider allowing a student an additional attempt as opposed to disregarding\nof marks, elements or modules, making this latter recommendation only when additional attempts\nare not possible or undesirable.\nAn Extenuating Circumstances Panel may not make a recommendation which would change a\npenalty for academic misconduct imposed by a School, Department or an Academic Misconduct\nCommittee e.g., a first sit cannot be offered for an assessment for which a penalty has been\nimposed. If an EC Panel makes a recommendation before the academic misconduct is detected,\nthe academic misconduct finding will void a recommendation made by an EC Panel.\n2. Potential outcomes\nPanels should list one of the outcomes below:\n(a) The claim is not approved because the grounds are not acceptable within the University’s\nExtenuating Circumstances Procedure.\n(b) The claim is not approved because the evidence provided does not cover the relevant\nperiod.\n(c) The claim is not approved because the evidence provided is not from an approved source.\n(d) The claim is not approved because the evidence provided is insufficient to support the claim\nof seriousness of impact."

Its\ncontent is only applicable to staff and students at the UK and China campuses.\nThe policy should be read in conjunction with the University’s Extenuating circumstances procedure:\nStudent Services - Extenuating circumstances procedure\nStudents may self-certificate absence from an examination(s) for a maximum of 2 consecutive\ncalendar days in an examination period, this includes e-exams. Students with a support plan that\nprovides additional time for examinations may self-certify absence if the examination duration is 48\nhours or less before any support plan adjustments are applied.\nKey principles\nIncludes: examination attendance; Guidance on acceptable circumstances and\nevidence; extenuating circumstances (EC)\nIn exceptional circumstances, where a student is prevented from attending an examination due to\ncircumstances which meet all of the criteria set out in section 1 of the Guidance on acceptable\ncircumstances and evidence (EC Procedure), they may use self-certification if they are unable to\nprovide any other form of evidence.\nThe circumstances must be out of the student’s control – the student could not have prevented\nthem.\nFor clarity, this policy is intended for use by students who, unexpectedly, are unable to\nattend an examination due to short-term, acute circumstances e.g. a migraine or sickness\nand diarrhoea, and who are unable to obtain medical evidence of this.\nIf a student wishes to give advance notice of their inability to sit an examination, evidence\nwill be required for this as part of their EC claim."
